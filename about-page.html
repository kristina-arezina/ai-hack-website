						<h3>What is Project Themis?</h3>
						<p>Project Themis is a student-run organization and social media platform that helps students transition into high school and provide students with resources, information, and tools needed in order to achieve success in high school. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>What do we do?</h3>
						<p>Our task as Project Themis representatives is to ensure students who need reminders or motivation throughout the school year get the support they need. We want to ensure every student is caught up with any COVID-19 updates, as well as providing them with useful tips to aid them throughout online schooling. </p>
						<h3>What can you expect from us?</h3>
						<p>From Project Themis, you can expect weekly themes related to trending events, mental health, school, etc. Each week, there will be a new theme and each theme consists of helpful resources, tips, tricks, and important information regarding that subject. You can also expect to hear student experiences and hear their story and how they were able to overcome their own tragedies, mental health, etc. Finally, you can expect workshops regarding mental health and stress such as mediation workshops, interviews with a licensed therapist, cooking, and much more!</p>
						<h3>What do we want to accomplish?</h3>
						<p>At Project Themis, our main priority is that you have an enjoyable high school experience. Project Themis wants to ensure that every student has someone to talk to and somewhere to turn to when they are feeling down, stressed, anxious, etc. We want every student to feel welcomed, prepared, and ready for their high school experience. Every student deserves a magical high school experience. We want to make your four years the best and most smooth years of your school experience.</p>
